## Udemy Clone

A front-end clone of the Udemy website built using HTML and CSS. This project replicates the core layout and styling of Udemy, including its navigation structure, course display format, and overall user interface. It provides a foundational look at how Udemy organizes its content and presents it in a visually engaging way.

## Project Goals

The purpose of this project is to practice front-end development skills by recreating the UI of a popular e-learning platform. This clone emphasizes the structure and layout of Udemy’s design, helping to improve knowledge of HTML semantics and CSS styling techniques.

## Features

Responsive Layout: Designed to be responsive across various screen sizes, providing a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
Navigation Bar: Replicates the navigation menu for exploring different sections, similar to Udemy’s main header.
Course Grid Layout: Displays a grid of courses with space for images, titles, and brief descriptions.
Course Detail Page (Mock): Includes a layout for individual course pages, structured to showcase course information.

## Technologies Used

HTML: Provides structure for all pages and organizes content into sections.
## CSS: Styles the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual elements, closely matching Udemy's look and feel.

## Future Improvements

If time permits, potential enhancements could include adding JavaScript for interactivity, animations, or expanding on the course detail pages to include mock descriptions and ratings. Additionally, integrating more advanced CSS techniques could refine the responsive design.
